# Nuvla Web UI

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nuvla/ui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nuvla/ui)

This repository provides a Docker image containing the Nuvla
browser-based user interface. This consists of Javascript code (built
with ClojureScript) and other support files (HTML, CSS, etc.).

## Artifacts

 - `nuvla/ui` - A Docker container containing the static content of
    the UI served by nginx.  Available from the [nuvla/ui
    repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/nuvla/ui) on Docker Hub.

## Release Process

**Before** creating the release:

 - Decide what semantic version to use for this release and change the
   version, if necessary, in `code/project.clj` and all the `pom.xml`
   files.  (It should still have the "-SNAPSHOT" suffix.)

 - Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

 - Push all changes to GitHub, including the updates to
   `CHANGELOG.md`.

Again, be sure to set the version **before** tagging the release.

Check that everything builds correctly with:

    mvn clean install

To tag the code with the release version and to update the master
branch to the next snapshot version, run the command:

    ./release.sh true

If you want to test what will happen with the release, leave off the
"true" argument and the changes will only be made locally.

When the tag is pushed to GitHub, Travis CI will build the repository,
create the container, and push it to Docker Hub.  Check the Travis
build and ensure that the new container version appears in the Docker
Hub. 

## Contributing

### Source Code Changes

To contribute code to this repository, please follow these steps:

 1. Create a branch from master with a descriptive, kebab-cased name
    to hold all your changes.

 2. Follow the developer guidelines concerning formatting, etc. when
    modifying the code.
   
 3. Once the changes are ready to be reviewed, create a GitHub pull
    request.  With the pull request, provide a description of the
    changes and links to any relevant issues (in this repository or
    others). 
   
 4. Ensure that the triggered CI checks all pass.  These are triggered
    automatically with the results shown directly in the pull request.

 5. Once the checks pass, assign the pull request to the repository
    coordinator (who may then assign it to someone else).

 6. Interact with the reviewer to address any comments.

When the reviewer is happy with the pull request, he/she will "squash
& merge" the pull request and delete the corresponding branch.

### Testing

Add appropriate tests that verify the changes or additions you make to
the source code.

### Code Formatting

The bulk of the code in this repository is written in Clojure.

The formatting follows the standard formatting provided by the Cursive
IntelliJ plugin with all the default settings **except that map
entries should be aligned**.

Additional, formatting guidelines, not handled by the Cursive plugin:

 - Use a new line after the `:require` and `:import` keys in namespace
   declarations.

 - Alphabetize the required namespaces.  This can be automated with
   `lein nsorg --replace`.

 - Use 2 blank lines between top-level forms.

 - Use a single blank line between a block comment and the following
   code.

IntelliJ (with Cursive) can format easily whole directories of source
code.  Do not hesitate to use this feature to keep the source code
formatting standardized.

## Frameworks and Libraries

Nuvla dependency:

 * [Nuvla Clojure(Script)
   API](https://github.com/nuvla/clojure-api): Provides
   a ClojureScript API for the CIMI and CIMI-like resources within
   Nuvla.

Frameworks:

 * [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent): Provides a
   ClojureScript interface to the
   [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) framework.
 * [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame): A framework that
   relies on React for visualization and provides mechanisms for using
   "FRP" for data flow and control.

Widgets:

 * [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction):
   React integration for Semantic UI.


## Development Environment

The essentials for using the development environment are below.

### Browser

To test the code on a Nuvla server (e.g. https://nuv.la/) running
on a different machine, you'll need to start a browser with the XSS
protections disabled.

For **Chrome** on MacOS, this can be done with:

```
$ open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app \
       --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir
```

For **Safari**, first enable the "Develop" menu:

 * Open the Safari preferences,
 * Click the "Advanced" tab, and
 * Then activate the "Show Develop menu in menu bar" option.

Once the "Develop" menu is visible, **choose the "Disable Cross-Origin
Restrictions" option**.

There may be **FireFox** plugins that will allow you to disable the
CORS protections.  The easier solution is to use Chrome or Safari.

### NPM

The build uses [shadow-cljs](http://shadow-cljs.org/) to facilitate
the use of Javascript modules packaged with NPM.  This requires that
you install the `npm` command line interface on your development
machine.

On Mac OS, the `npm` command comes with the Node.js distribution of
Homebrew.  Just run the command `brew install node`.

For other distributions or for direct installation on Mac OS, take a
look at the Node.js [downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
page. 

### Leiningen

The development environment requires
[`lein`](https://leiningen.org). Follow the instructions on the
Leiningen website to install the tool.

### Workflow

Once all of the development tools have been installed, the workflow is
as follows:

 1. Run `npm install` at the root of the cloned repository.  This only
    needs to be done once at the beginning and then whenever
    dependencies change.

 2. Start a development server for the build with `lein dev`.  When
    this completes ("build completed" message in the terminal), you
    can then connect to the process on http://localhost:8280.

 3. Changes you make to the code should automatically be recompiled
    and then pushed to your browser.

 4. If you need a REPL, you can run the command `lein cljs-repl` from
    a different terminal.

 5. You can terminate the process with Ctrl-C from the terminal window. 

## Integration with IntelliJ

You can import the repository through IntelliJ, using the "leiningen"
method in the dialog.

If you have the IntelliJ command line installed, the shadow-cljs
heads-up display, should open files in the IntelliJ editor.

The command for opening Chrome with the security disabled, can be
configured as an "external tool" in IntelliJ.  In "Preferences", go to
the "Tools" -> "External Tools" panel.

### Logging

You can reset the logging level for kvlt from the REPL when running
in development mode. From the REPL do:

```
=> (require '[taoensso.timbre :as timbre])
=> (timbre/set-level! :info)
```

The default value is `:debug` which will log all of the HTTP requests
and responses.  This is useful when debugging interactions with
Nuvla, but annoying otherwise.
